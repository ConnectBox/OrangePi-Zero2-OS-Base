# OrangePi-Zero2-OS-Base
Base OS for build of OrangePiZero2
This repository is for the base images on which to build Connectbox firmware.  
This will be updated periodically with new images.  All images are in zip format 
split at 100M boundaries.  You will need to download all of the image pieces and unzip the
group into a single image file.
